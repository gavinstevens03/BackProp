## XOR Classification 
In this Jupyter notebook, I first sought to solve the XOR classification problem. The XOR classification problem is a binary, non-linearly separable problem that requires a multi-layered network to properly classify. 

The first part of this notebook is preparing sample training and testing patterns for the XOR setup. These datasets are graphed in matplotlib.

## Multi-Layered Network for XOR
The next part of this assignment involves creating and testing network architecture settings and seeing how they perform in classifying the training data.

Within the notebook, I have discussed my thought process when it comes to configuring the network to increase accuracy without overtraining.

## Non-XOR Network
Then, I created another arbitrary classification problem that was not linearly separable. I wanted to test my knowledge of configuring networks. Again, I documented how I tested the architecture in a markdown cell.
